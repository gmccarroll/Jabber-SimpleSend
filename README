This is a very simple module that wraps Net::Jabber and allows you to
send a Jabber message very easily. To use it you will need a
registered JID and password - the normal one you use for your
Jabber.org will be fine for testing.

The most interesting thing is probably the test procedure, it basically
emails a Jabber bot your hostname and localtime, waits 5 seconds and then
downloads a webpage via LWP that the Jabber bot maintains and should of
put your hostname and localtime on.

If you don't want to give away your hostname, feel free to edit the
$string variable in the test program.

Greg.
